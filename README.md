Hi Everyone! My name is Asmat Khattak and I am a researcher currently working on data science projects. I am learning github for my projects to collaborate with people who have similar goals like me. 

## My Career Passions
I really love working in tech. Specifically, I love being in passion where I can help others build something amazing! Whether that's being a manager, or working with customers and relaying that information back to the developers, that is my sweet spot! I enjoy teaching and learning, so any role that enables me to flex my education muscles is the right role for me, that's why I really enjoy writing.

One of my favourite things to do is to watch TV series and practice language.
